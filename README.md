👋 About the project

This project is my personal portfolio website. It’s a space that represents who I am, what I build, and how I approach development. The site is intentionally simple and fast, focusing on clean design, clear structure, and smooth interactions rather than heavy frameworks or unnecessary complexity.

Everything here is built with plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I wanted full control over the layout, styling, and behavior, and building it from the ground up helped me better understand how the pieces fit together without abstractions doing the work for me.

🎨 Design & structure

The design focuses on clarity and personality. Layout, spacing, and color choices are intentional, aiming to feel modern without being distracting. The site is responsive and designed to work across different screen sizes while keeping the experience consistent.

JavaScript is used to enhance interactivity and polish, not to overcomplicate things. Animations, transitions, and dynamic elements exist to support the experience rather than take attention away from the content.

⚙️ Built with

This project uses standard web technologies that run directly in the browser. HTML provides the structure, CSS handles layout and styling, and JavaScript adds interactivity and logic. No external frameworks are required to run the site.

🚀 Purpose

This portfolio exists as both a showcase and a learning project. It highlights my current skills while also serving as a foundation I can continue improving over time. As I grow as a developer, this site will evolve alongside me.

If you’re a recruiter, collaborator, or just browsing, feel free to explore the code and see how things are structured. I keep things readable and organized on purpose.
