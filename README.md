This project is my personal portfolio website. It’s a digital space that represents me as a developer, my mindset, and the kind of work I care about. The focus is on clarity, simplicity, and intention rather than overwhelming visuals or heavy tooling.

The entire site is built using plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I chose to avoid frameworks so I could work closer to the fundamentals of the web and have full control over structure, layout, and behavior.

<br/> <h2 style="color:#6C63FF;">Design & Experience</h2>

The design leans toward minimal and modern. Spacing, typography, and color choices are deliberate, aiming to keep the content readable and the layout calm. The site is responsive and adapts smoothly across different screen sizes.

JavaScript is used to enhance the experience where it makes sense. Interactions and animations are subtle and purposeful, supporting the content instead of competing with it.

<br/> <h2 style="color:#6C63FF;">Why this exists</h2>

This portfolio is both a showcase and a personal checkpoint. It reflects my current skill level while giving me room to iterate and improve as I learn more. I treat it as a living project rather than a finished one.

If you’re looking through the code, you’ll notice an emphasis on readability and structure. I want it to be easy to understand not just what I built, but why I built it that way.
