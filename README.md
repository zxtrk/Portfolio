This project is my personal portfolio website. It’s a digital space that represents me as a developer, my mindset, and the kind of work I care about. The focus is on clarity, simplicity, and intention rather than overwhelming visuals or heavy tooling.

The entire site is built using plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I chose to avoid frameworks so I could work closer to the fundamentals of the web and have full control over structure, layout, and behavior.

<br/> <h2 style="color:#7B6CFF;">Design & Experience</h2>

The design leans modern and minimal, with color used as an accent rather than a distraction. Spacing and typography are deliberate, keeping the layout calm and readable. The site adapts smoothly across screen sizes while maintaining a consistent feel.

JavaScript adds small but meaningful interactions. Animations and dynamic elements are subtle, designed to enhance the experience without pulling focus away from the content.

<br/> <h2 style="color:#7B6CFF;">Why this exists</h2>

This portfolio is both a showcase and a checkpoint. It reflects my current skill set while giving me space to refine and improve as I grow. It’s treated as a living project, not a finished product.

If you’re reviewing the code, you’ll find an emphasis on clarity and structure. Every choice is made to be understandable, maintainable, and intentional.
