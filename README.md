This project is my personal portfolio website. It serves as a concise and focused representation of who I am as a developer and how I approach building for the web. The emphasis is on clarity, structure, and thoughtful design rather than unnecessary complexity.

The site is built entirely with standard web technologies. Using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript allows for complete control over structure, styling, and behavior while keeping the codebase lightweight and easy to understand.

<br/> <h2 style="color:#374151; font-weight:600;">Design Philosophy</h2>

The design is intentionally minimal and professional. Typography, spacing, and color are used with restraint to create a clean reading experience and a balanced layout. The interface adapts smoothly across screen sizes while maintaining consistency and visual hierarchy.

JavaScript is used selectively to enhance usability and interaction. All dynamic behavior is purposeful and designed to support the content rather than distract from it.

<br/> <h2 style="color:#374151; font-weight:600;">Intent</h2>

This portfolio exists as both a showcase and a foundation. It reflects my current skill set while remaining flexible enough to evolve as I continue learning and refining my craft. The project is treated as a living document rather than a finished artifact.

The code prioritizes readability and maintainability. Naming, structure, and organization are deliberate so that the intent behind each decision is clear.
